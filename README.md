# DSE-Group13
Add all project .py files into the "DSE" folder. You can ignore the .pyproj file in there, that is sepcific to Visual Studios 2017.
You can also ignore the .sln file which is also specific to Visual Studios 2017. You can create as many sub folders as you like within the "DSE" folder, and in each sub folder you can add as many related .py files as you want. You can also directly add .py files to the "DSE" folder as oppose to making sub folders (however, please try to be organized when doing so). Also DO NOT delete the DSE.py or DSE.pyproj.
Please have a look at "PreviewOfFolderOrganization.png" to have a better understanding of the folder organization.
